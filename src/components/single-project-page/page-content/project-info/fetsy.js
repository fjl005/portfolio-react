### Introduction
Rewinding back to June of 2023, there were two key components of my life that intertwined into this project:
* I ran an [Etsy Shop](https://www.digiwitz.etsy.com) (and still do today), selling digital cards and templates of various types.
* I finished up my coding bootcamp, and wanted to further my knowledge of user authentication, administrator authorization, and manipulation of data from a data storage via Node.JS, Express, and MongoDB.

I then thought to myself, *“wouldn’t it be a great idea to implement what I’ve learned from NuCamp to recreate my own online shop apart from Etsy?”*

Thus, the idea was born, and I was ready to commit the next several months to this endeavor.


### Why It Matters
On Etsy, my average product price is about $4.50 per template. Etsy takes essentially half of that from fees and advertising. While the difference between $2.25 and $4.50 isn’t much, the difference is definitely noticeable if I make, for example, 100 sales in a given month ($225 vs $450). 

As a goal to combat these fees, I would like to create my own ecommerce platform so that I don’t need to implement any additional fees, taking nearly 100% of the sales as profit.

I do acknowledge, however, that this project in its entirety will take many months and perhaps years to have every component of the site functioning professionally and perfectly. Beyond the minimum viable product, I’m referring to:
* Incorporating seamless user interfaces paired with professional graphic design, 
* Managing data storage securely and sustainably to a larger scale,
* Marketing and driving customers to my shop via social media platforms,
* Overseeing and handling actual financial payments, 
* Creating a mobile version via React Native, 
* Establishing opportunities to run sales and coupons.

So, for this current project, my focus is to create the minimum viable product (MVP). When I successfully transition into the web developer industry, I’ll revisit this project and plan to complete it entirely.
