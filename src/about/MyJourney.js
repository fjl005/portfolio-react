            <p>
                Though I've spent the past few years in the bio industry, my interest in tech traces back to high school, where I first delved into the world of coding during my Java class. I vividly recall the exhilaration of creating a simple Pong game from <a href='https://scratch.mit.edu/' target='_blank' className='anchor-lightblue' rel='noreferrer'>Scratch</a>, MIT's user-friendly coding language, and implementing a program that could pixelate images. For once, I met a school subject that captured my interest. However, my father, with his engineering background, adamantly discouraged me from pursuing this path, citing his own challenging experiences.

                Respecting his guidance, I followed a different route in college, studying biology with the intention of becoming a doctor. Yet, as time passed, it became apparent that this path wasn't mine — <strong className='strong-lightblue'>it was my father's dream, not my own</strong>. Having graduated with a Masters in Biology, I pivoted into cancer research, hoping to find fulfillment in a related field, only to discover that it left me uninspired and stagnant in my growth as a scientist.

                Faced with a quarter-life crisis (among other non-career related issues), I embarked on a journey of introspection, questioning how I envisioned my future career. And then, in a moment of bold defiance, I dared to challenge my father's advice. In January 2023, I took the leap and enrolled in Nucamp's Full Stack bootcamp course — a decision driven by an unwavering belief in my passion for programming, logic, and web development.

                I had decided to prioritize my own dreams and aspirations, embracing the joy and fulfillment that comes from building websites and solving complex problems. <strong className='strong-lightblue'>This decision not only reinvigorated my spirit but also ignited a newfound drive to continually push myself to greater heights.</strong>
